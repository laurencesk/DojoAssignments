                      <h3>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots(commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snashot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiement and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experienments into the your app.</h3>
